The idea of this directory is to collect Waterloo created
programs here so that when moving to new versions of OS161
we have them all in one place and we know what we need
to move/port. It structure and functionality is
similar to the testbin except to simply the
Makefile in each directory they all include uw-prog.mk
from this directory.

I'm starting by trying to add a few of the programs that
get used by some of the automated testing scripts.

syscall   - example program: how a syscall works used in the course notes
segments  - example program: how different segments used in the course notes
argtest   - is a useful program that I ask people to use when 
            when trying to implement argc/argv.

vm-funcs  - code that is used by some of the vm-* tests
vm-*      - are a bunch of different test programs I wrote
            to try to test the VM subsystem for assignment 3.

lib       - some libraries that are used by some other programs
files1    - test a number of relatively simple case for
files2      open, close, read and write
writeread - write stuff to a file and then read it and ensure what
            is read matches what was written
conc-io   - tests concurrent writes and atomicity

romewrite  - tries to write to read only memory
tlbfaulter - create and use an array larger than will fit in the TLB
             but should fit in memory and should force TLB replacements
sparse     - declare a large array but only use a small part of it
