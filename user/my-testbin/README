My-Testbin Documentation

NOTE: You must use bmake for building programs
in this directory.

The my-testbin folder is designed to be recompiled with the
remainder of the testcases or on its own.  
Whenever bmake <depend|clean|all|install> in the main/toplevel
os161 directory, my-testbin will be recompiled.

The compilation process iterates over all subdirectories in
my-testbin, compiling and linking the code within them.
The final executable will have the name specified
within the Makefile in the subdirectory (usually the same
name as the directory).  This, would mean that each test case
would be uniquly identified by the folder name.

HOWTOs:

Create a new Testcase:

* Create a new folder in my-testbin
* Add the .c and .h source to that directory
* Go to my-testbin and execute `bmake`
* Finally run `bmake install` to copy the binaries to 
  root/my-testbin

Running new testcases:

* The new testcases will be installed in root/my-testbin
* run them with the "p my-testbin/<testname>" options
  to the kernel.

See the Makefile in this directory and example/Makefile
for and example of how to add new programs.

It is probably simplest to put each program in a 
separate directory. You can copy the Makefile from
the example directory and then modify the line 
that defines the program name to the name
of the new program.
